[ This is -*- indented-text -*- ]

A running / fitness log is evolving here.

The plan is to use directories of plain-text files to track activities,
with cross references to GPS files and other media (e.g. photos, web
URLs). Storing the files in a Dropbox directory will sync the ad hoc
database between systems.

The end state will be a mac application to browse by date and
examine/edit each entry, with maps and charting for activities with GPS
data. Initially though, am focusing on a suite of shell commands with a
common interface to get a feel for how the data format works. Basic
command structure:

$ act [--dir DIR] [--gps-dir DIR] COMMAND ARGS...

The --dir and --gps-dir options are used to set ACT_DIR and ACT_GPS_DIR
environment variables if given. Each command is a separate program
called act-COMMAND. Some possible commands are:

$ act new [--edit] [CREATION-OPTIONS...]

	Creates a new activity file. If no --date option, defaults to
	current time. (Date: is only required header.) If --edit
	option is specified launches editor on initial file.

$ act import [--edit] [CREATION-OPTIONS...]

	Finds new Garmin files and creates activities from them. (I.e.
	calls "act new" with --fit-file option.)

$ act set [--multiple] [CREATION-OPTIONS] [ACTIVITY-RANGE ...]

	Uses the options to change the specified activity. If the spec
	selects more than one activity exit with an error unless
	--multiple option was given.

where CREATION-OPTIONS are any of:

	--date DATE
	--activity X
	--type X
	--course X
	--keywords X[,Y]
	--equipment X[,Y]
	--distance X
	--duration X
	--pace X
	--speed X
	--max-pace X
	--max-speed X
	--resting-hr X
	--average-hr X
	--max-hr X
	--calories X
	--weight X
	--temperature X[,Y]
	--weather X
	--quality X
	--effort X
	--fit-file X
	--tcx-file X
	--field TAG=X

For identifying activities we have ACTIVITY-RANGE, which is one of these
forms:

	DATE
	DATE-ABBREV		-- "today", "this-week", "last-week", etc
	#10			-- date of 10th most recent activity

given a single item spec like this we can concatenate to form a range, e.g.

	DATE0..DATE1
	#10..#20

or ask for N items from that point:

	DATE@20
	@20			-- 20 most recent items (gdb syntax!)

note that underspecified dates already form a range, e.g. "2013-07" is
the entire month of July, and "12pm" is [12:00, 13:00). Combining two
dates to form a range does the obvious thing (min/max of endpoints).
Adding two ranges preserves the hole between them. If no spec is given,
the command operates on the most recent activity.

$ act edit [ACTIVITY-RANGE ...]

	Runs $EDITOR on the specified file(s).

$ act log [LOG-OPTIONS...] [ACTIVITY-RANGE ...]

	Prints activities. The options allow the range of activities,
	and what is printed to be controlled.

$ act show [LOG-OPTIONS...] [ACTIVITY-RANGE ...]

	Prints one activity.

$ act summary [SUMMARY-OPTIONS...] ACTIVITY-RANGE

	Summarizes a range of activities. E.g. prints weekly mileage
	for the past year.

$ act locate [ACTIVITY-RANGE ...]

	Prints file names for all specified activities.

$ act rm [ACTIVITY-RANGE ...]

	Deletes specified activities. Note that this is a "soft"
	deletion, either by adding a "Deleted: YES" header to the file,
	or by moving it to a trash directory.

$ act unrm [ACTIVITY-RANGE ...]

	Clears the deleted state.

$ act gc

	Removes any deleted activities, and does any other cleanup that
	might be needed.
