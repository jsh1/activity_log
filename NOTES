## Issues

1. Refactor activity class.

   Currently there's just one class act::activity, that handles
   everything. Split it into at least two pieces:

   act::activity

     High-level class. Lazily caches known fields and their units in
     parsed form. Has a reference to an activity_storage instance. Adds
     extra semantic knowledge, e.g. if no pace field, compute it from
     duration and distance. If unable to compute a field, pull values
     from any associated GPS file.

   act::activity_storage

     Manages key-value store and its file I/O -- only strings, no
     interpretation of data, but does separate headers from body.
     Constructed with a path? Stores the mtime of the file?


## File Format Notes

Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [AM|PM] [TZ]
Activity: STRING			-- run | bike | note | ...
Type: STRING				-- easy | ...
Course: STRING
Keywords: KEYWORD-LIST			-- mile-reps
Equipment: KEYWORD-LIST			-- nike-lunar-montreal-grey
Distance: DISTANCE			-- 8.3 miles
Duration: DURATION			-- 1:05:10.4
Pace: PACE				-- 7:10/mi
Speed: SPEED				-- 10 m/s
Max-Pace: PACE
Max-Speed: SPEED
Resting-HR: NUMBER
Average-HR: NUMBER
Max-HR: NUMBER
Calories: NUMBER
Weight: NUMBER UNIT			-- 150 pounds
Temperature: TEMPERATURE		-- 28C | 72 F | 22 celsius
Weather: KEYWORD-LIST			-- cloudy drizzle
Quality: FRACTION
Effort: FRACTION
GPS-File: FILENAME			-- 2013-06-26-09-36-12.fit

So semantic field types are:

	Name		Format			Unit
	----		------			----
	DATE
	DISTANCE	NNN DISTANCE-UNIT	m
	DURATION	[[HH:]MM:]SS[.SS]	s
	PACE		DURATION PACE-UNIT	m/s
	SPEED		DISTANCE SPEED-UNIT	m/s
	TEMPERATURE	NNN TEMPERATURE-UNIT	deg C
	KEYWORD-LIST	KEY1 KEY2 ... KEY-N
	FRACTION	N/N, N%

almost using SI units, but C not Kelvin.

Minor format pieces are:

	DISTANCE-UNIT		mi|mile[s], kilometres|km, metres|m, feet|ft
	PACE-UNIT		/DISTANCE-UNIT
	SPEED-UNIT		DISTANCE-UNIT / [s|m|h], mph
	TEMPERATURE-UNIT	[degrees] c[elsius]|f[ahrenheit]


## Example entry

--
Date: 2013-06-26 09:36:12 -0900
Course: Mission Bay
Activity: run
Type: easy
Distance: 6.28 miles
Duration: 51:20	
GPS-File: 2013-06-26-09-36-12.fit

Felt good, slightly sore left hip.

Easy run around the bay path, nice day to be out and about.

this is ~270 bytes. Let's say 500 bytes per entry. For 400 entries per
year, that is 200KB. So concatenating entries into one file does not
seem unreasonable, although that might be a bit much for Dropbox to
sync every time?

So best place to start may be with one file per activity, load them all
into memory on startup, then optimize as necessary from there.
