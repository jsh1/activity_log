## Common Fields

Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [AM|PM] [TZ]
Activity: STRING			-- run | bike | note | ...
Type: STRING				-- easy | ...
Course: STRING
Keywords: KEYWORD-LIST			-- mile-reps
Equipment: KEYWORD-LIST			-- nike-lunar-montreal-grey
Distance: DISTANCE			-- 8.3 miles
Duration: DURATION			-- 1:05:10.4
Pace: PACE				-- 7:10/mi
Speed: SPEED				-- 10 m/s
Max-Pace: PACE
Max-Speed: SPEED
Rest-HR: NUMBER
Avg-HR: NUMBER
Max-HR: NUMBER
Calories: NUMBER
Weight: NUMBER UNIT			-- 150 pounds
Temperature: TEMPERATURE		-- 28C
Weather: KEYWORD-LIST			-- cloudy drizzle

So semantic field types are:

	Name		Format			Unit
	----		------			----
	DATE
	DISTANCE	NNN DISTANCE-UNIT	m
	DURATION	[[HH:]MM:]SS[.SS]	s
	PACE		DURATION PACE-UNIT	m/s
	SPEED		DISTANCE SPEED-UNIT	m/s
	TEMPERATURE	NNN TEMPERATURE-UNIT	deg C
	KEYWORD-LIST	KEY1 KEY2 ... KEY-N
	FRACTION	N/N, N%

almost using SI units, but C not Kelvin.

Minor format pieces are:

	DISTANCE-UNIT		mi|mile[s], kilometres|km, metres|m, feet|ft
	PACE-UNIT		/DISTANCE-UNIT
	SPEED-UNIT		DISTANCE-UNIT / [s|m|h], mph
	TEMPERATURE-UNIT	[degrees] c[elsius]|f[ahrenheit]

## Example entry

From jsh				-- mbox start line
Date: 2013-06-26 09:36:12 -0900
Course: Mission Bay
Activity: run
Type: easy
Distance: 6.28 miles
Duration: 51:20

Felt good, slightly sore left hip.

Easy run around the bay path, nice day to be out and about.

this is ~270 bytes. Let's say 500 bytes per entry. For 400 entries per
year, that is 200KB. So concatenating entries into one file does not
seem unreasonable, although that might be a bit much for Dropbox to
sync every time?

So best place to start may be with one file per activity, load them all
into memory on startup, then optimize as necessary from there.
